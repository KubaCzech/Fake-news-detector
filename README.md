## Description
This repository contains Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that detects whether the article is **real** or contains **fake news**. 

With misinformation spreading rapidly on social media, having lightweight tools to flag potentially fake content is crucial. This model is built using Python and traditional machine learning techniques, making it fast and easy to interpret.

Dataset was taken from kaggle website: [Fake News Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emineyetm/fake-news-detection-datasets/data?select=News+_dataset)
